# SKILL.md Quality Best Practices

Reference guide for writing high-quality SKILL.md files in this project. Based on [skills-best-practices](https://github.com/mgechev/skills-best-practices).

## Frontmatter

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
name: angular-best-practices-<library>
description: >-
  <What it does>. <When it activates>.
  <Negative triggers — when NOT to use>.
  Install alongside angular-best-practices for full coverage.
version: "1.1.0"
tags: [angular, <library>, <domain>]
globs:
  - "**/*.ts"
  - "**/*.<pattern>.ts"
---
```

### Description Best Practices

1. **First sentence:** What the skill does (action-oriented)
2. **Activation trigger:** When the skill should activate (e.g., "Activates when working with @ngrx/store")
3. **Negative triggers:** When NOT to use (e.g., "Do not use for React, Vue, or AngularJS 1.x projects")
4. **Cross-reference:** "Install alongside angular-best-practices for full coverage."

Negative triggers prevent false activation on similar-sounding but unrelated tasks.

### Tags

- Include `angular` as the first tag
- Add the library name as a tag (e.g., `ngrx`, `primeng`)
- Add the domain (e.g., `state-management`, `ui-components`, `i18n`)
- 3-5 tags total

### Globs

- Always include `"**/*.ts"`
- Add library-specific patterns (e.g., `"**/*.reducer.ts"`, `"**/*.store.ts"`)
- Add template files if the skill affects templates (`"**/*.html"`)

## Directory Structure

```
skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md          # < 500 lines; main instructions
  AGENTS.md         # Generated by build — do not edit manually
```

For internal contributor skills (`.claude/skills/`):

```
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md          # < 500 lines; main instructions
  references/       # Supporting docs loaded on demand
  prompts/          # Prompt templates for specific operations
  config/           # Structured data (JSON) for thresholds
```

### Size Limits

- **SKILL.md:** Under 500 lines. If exceeding, extract into `references/`, `prompts/`, or `config/`
- **JiT loading:** Reference extracted files with "Read `path/to/file` for X" instead of inlining content
- **No duplication:** Never repeat content that exists in subdirectory files

## Instruction Voice

1. **Third-person imperative:** "Review rules for accuracy" not "You are an expert who reviews rules"
2. **Step-by-step numbering:** Use numbered lists for multi-step processes
3. **Concrete templates:** Show exact output format, not vague descriptions
4. **Action verbs first:** "Verify code compiles" not "The code should be verified"

## Content Organization

### Required Sections (published skills)

1. **Title** — `# Angular <Library> Best Practices`
2. **Summary** — 1-2 sentences on what and why
3. **Links** — Repository, core skill, browse page
4. **When to Apply** — 3-5 concrete trigger scenarios
5. **Rules table** — Rule name, impact, one-line description
6. **Install** — Core skill + this add-on commands

### Required Sections (internal contributor skills)

1. **Title** — `# <Agent Name>`
2. **Core Mission** — What the agent does (1-2 sentences)
3. **Process** — Numbered steps for the main workflow
4. **Tools** — Which tools to use and when
5. **Output Format** — Exact template for results
6. **Commands** — Example invocations

## Terminology Consistency

Use canonical Angular terms throughout:

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| template | HTML file |
| `inject()` | constructor injection |
| signal inputs | `@Input()` decorator |
| signal outputs | `@Output()` decorator |
| control flow (`@if`, `@for`) | structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) |
| `OnPush` | default change detection |
| `computed()` | getter-based derivation |

## Validation Checklist

### Discovery Validation

- [ ] Description contains positive triggers (what it does)
- [ ] Description contains negative triggers (what it does NOT do)
- [ ] Tags are specific and non-overlapping with other skills
- [ ] Globs match the file types the skill applies to

### Logic Validation

- [ ] All code examples use Angular 17+ APIs
- [ ] No deprecated patterns (`@Input`, `*ngIf`, constructor injection)
- [ ] Decision criteria are specific with measurable thresholds
- [ ] JiT loading references point to files that exist

### Edge Case Testing

- [ ] Skill does not activate for AngularJS (1.x) projects
- [ ] Skill does not activate for React/Vue/Svelte projects
- [ ] Library-specific skills do not overlap with core skill rules
- [ ] Optional skills reference the core skill for installation
