## Unit Testing with Vitest

Use Vitest for unit testing services, pipes, guards, and signals. For signals, set values directly and assert computed results. For pipes, instantiate and call `transform()`.

```typescript
it('should fetch users', async () => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({ imports: [HttpClientTestingModule] });
  const service = TestBed.inject(UserService);
  expect(await firstValueFrom(service.getUsers())).toBeDefined();
});
```
